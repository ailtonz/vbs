### Description : Changes the drive letter of volume D to Q. If you modify this script to change the drive letter of a volume other than D, note that the volume name in the WQL query must include both the colon (:) and two  slashes (\\). Thus drive C would look like this: C:\\. When specifying the new drive letter, however, you only have to include the colon (in the sample script, Q:).
